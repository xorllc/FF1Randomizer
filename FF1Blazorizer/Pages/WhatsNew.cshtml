		<h1>Version 3.0.0</h1>
		<p>A FINAL FANTASY RANDOMIZER!!</p>
		<p>This HELP will lead us</p>
		<p>to solve the riddle of</p>
		<p>the Randomizer!!</p>
		<p>Now, listen to me....</p>
		<h1>Version 2.6.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="BetterTrapChests">Better trap treasure</h3>
				When shuffling or randomizing treasures, this option attempts to place more interesting items in
				chests which are guarded by forced fights.
				<div>
					<img src="images/TrapTiles.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
				</div>
				The chests included in this option include:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://mikesrpgcenter.com/ffantasy/maps/templeoffiends.html" target="_blank">Temple of Fiends</a> (locked): "Soft", "Rune Sword"</li>
					<li><a href="http://mikesrpgcenter.com/ffantasy/maps/marshcave.html" target="_blank">Marsh Cave</a> (locked): B3 "Silver Dagger"</li>

					Wizard Rod, Xcalber, Zeus Gauntlets
				</div>
				<b>Note:</b> If a chest was incentivized (such as the "Floater" chest in Ice Cave), it won't be included in this
				treasure placement, even if it doesn't have an incentive item.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Version 2.5.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>None Class</h3>
				The None class creates a class of useless, permanently dead characters. Nones are still named and
				can still carry gear. However they cannot ever be resurrected and will never gain experience. Nones
				are mostly a shortcut for killing off characters to level up faster, but are simply permanent from the
				moment the game begins until it ends.
				<div>
					<img src="images/NoneSelection.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
					<img src="images/None.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
				</div>
				This is the None class at character selection time, and in battle. They are completely invisible throughout
				the game as if to reduce the total size of the party. They can still be given gear to hold though
				they cannot equip anything.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Party Composition</h3>
				Forced party controls are now vastly improved. Each individual slot can now be toggled per
				class, which allows for some really interesting customization, for example:
				<ul>
					<li>Slot 1 is forced to Fighter.</li>
					<li>Slot 2 is forced to Fighter or Thief or None and randomly selected and locked.</li>
					<li>Slot 3 could be set to Red or White Mage, but allow user selection.</li>
					<li>Slot 4 could be forbidden from being a Fighter, but allow anything else.</li>
					<li>
						If the "Forced?" box is checked, the slot will be forced randomly from the available options
						depending on the seed. If unchecked, the player will be able to choose from the selected boxes.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="RandomShops">Random Shops</h3>
				When shuffling <b>Random Weapons and Armor, Including Caster Items and Elite Gear</b> is now a separate flag.
				Unchecking it will remove the following items from the pool that could ever be for sale:
				<ul>
					<li>Light Axe, Mage Rod, Wizard Staff, Defense, Thor Hammer, Bane Sword, Heal Rod</li>
					<li>Masmune, XCalber, Vorpal, Sun Sword, Katana</li>
					<li>Heal Helm, White Shirt, Black Shirt, Zeus Gauntlet, Power Gauntlet</li>
					<li>Dragon Armor, Aegis Shield, Ribbon</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Enemy Formations Frequency is now a Drop down!</h3>
				Instead of just shuffling the relative frequencies within a zone, there are now more options.
				<ul>
					<li>Don't Shuffle Encounters sticks with the vanilla behavior.</li>
					<li>Shuffle Encounter Rarity has the same behavior as before, changing the relative rarity within a zone.</li>
					<li>Shuffle All Encounters Across Zones does just that, shuffling all the enounters into other tables</li>
					<li>Randomize Encounter Zones makes all zones randomly generated with possible duplications across them.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Randomized Treasures</h3>
				When shuffling Treasures it's now possible to totally randomize them. This allows duplicates of rare items
				and also means things like CatClaw might be found in chests, and so on. There is a dropdown of to provide
				the overall wealth of the world, with higher wealths yielding a greater number of the best tiems and fewer
				of the worst items. Naturally the reverse is also true, with the lowest settings being potentially grueling
				seeds with potentially very little good endgame equipment to work with.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Scale Clamping Minimums to 100%</h3>
				When scaling prices and enemy stats there is now a checkbox to set the minimum to 100%. This not only prevents anything
				from being easier than vanilla but it actually bumps up the average result to the midpoint of 100% and your higher choice.
				For example, if you set 100% to 300%, the average enemy will actually have 200% hp! Be warned!
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Three Battle Palettes</h3>
				This is a more advanced Fun% feature for modding enthusiasts. It changes the game to use three sprite palettes for the party
				instead of just two, which allows a greater color variety on screen at once. The leverage it, a modder must make a copy of the
				ROM where some of the classes have their palette set to number 3. The downside is that characters which have been turned to stone
				will share their palette with weapons and spell effects during battles.

		</ul>
		<h2>Minor Features &amp; Other Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fix a bug where the Mystic Key could have been placed in the first two chests of the Temple of Fiends Revisited.</li>
			<li>Shuffle Objective NPCs allows the shuffling of the locations of Dr. Unne, The Elf Doctor, and Bahamut between their three locations.</li>
			<li>Disable Damage Tile Flicker removes the flickering when stepping on damage tiles. The noise, damage, and lack of encounters remains of course.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Version 2.4.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="EntranceShuffle">Entrance Shuffle</h3>
				<p>
					Entrance randomization adds a whole new level of exploration. It breaks down into Entrance,
					Floor, and Town Shuffling. <b>All forms of Entrance Shuffling Require NPC Item Shuffle to be enabled.</b>
					Without shuffling NPCs the world map would be fairly restricted anyway. Therefore, to enforce the high degree
					of variety this feature is designed to create, NPC Item Shuffle is required for Entrance Shuffle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, when Princess Sara is rescued following the initial battle with Garland, the party <b>
						is not
						teleported along with her to Coneria Castle
					</b>. With the entrances shuffled it might not be possible for
					the party to get back to the Temple of Fiends entrance where they may have parked their boat or ship! Even
					if it would be possible, for the sake of consistency, that teleport is disabled.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Entrances</b> connect any entrance to any dungeon. For example, the Temple of Fiends
						entrance may now take you to the Earth Cave. The Volcano Entrance might now lead to the
						Waterfall. Where technical limitations allow, the new dungeon is tinted to match the
						entrance to help you remember how you entered. Observe in the pictures below the Marsh
						Cave has been tinted red to indicate it was entered through the Volcano entrance. The
						Earth Cave is teal because it was reached through a Cardia cave.
						<div>
							<img src="images/VolcanoMarsh.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
							<img src="images/CardiaEarth.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
						</div>
						<br />
						Several new palettes hvae been created as well for some the castles and towns that
						previously used to all share one. Observe below how Sarda's Cave is now tinted a new pink - this
						palette applies to the Elfland entrance (and requires Town shuffle, explained below).
						Finally the yellow-green Ice Cave floor shown to the right was reached through the
						Crescent Lake entrance. Explore Entrance Shuffle mode to discover all the others!
						<div>
							<img src="images/SardaElfland.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
							<img src="images/IceCaveCL.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px;" />
							<br />
						</div>
						<br />
						<p>
							Remember, <b>Entrance Shuffle creates an new focus on exploration!</b> One needs to realize
							that the quest items may now come out of order, because <b>
								all dungeons might have different
								requirements to be accessed.
							</b> The CHIME might just lead to an unimportant Cardia cave,
							while the eastern entrance to the Titan's Tunnel may be the Sea Shrine.
						</p>
						<p>
							Onrac is considered a town, so Entrance Shuffle does not move it. However, its entrance
							to the Sea Shrine is considered an entrance, so the OXYALE is required to gain access to
							whereever it leads. Note this may be a meaningless destination like an empty Cardia cave,
							or it may be something as important as the Temple of Fiends.
						</p>
						<br />&nbsp;
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Towns</b> adds the towns into the mix so they can appear outside of their original
						entrances. They are also tinted when they appear in a dungeon entrance to help you
						remember how you got there. For example, here is Melmond with the purple of Matoya's
						Cave, The Brown of Sarda's Cave, and the pale green of the Marsh Cave, and an original
						Sage Green palette added for the Elfland Castle entrance. When a town is shuffled to
						another town's entrance, it is <b>not</b> tinted. The normal town palette is designed to
						remind you that the town was found at <b>some vanilla town location.</b>
						<div>
							<img src="images/MelmondPurple.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 250px;" />
							<img src="images/MelmondBrown.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 250px;" />
							<img src="images/MelmondPaleGreen.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 250px;" />
							<img src="images/MelmondSageGreen.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 250px;" />
						</div>
						<br />&nbsp;
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Floors</b> really mixes things up by allowing almost any connecting stairs to lead
						to any floor of any other dungeon. Virtually all dungeon floors in the game can be
						shuffled into any ordering, with the exception of the following list which are <b>
							not
							shuffled:
						</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Ice Cave from the Pit Room onward.</li>
							<li>Castle Ordeals</li>
							<li>Coneria Castle</li>
							<li>Temple of Fiends & Revisited</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Of course this means things like the CUBE and ROD <b>might not be required</b>. The room
							after the Vampire might just be a dead end in Cardia; the CUBE might just lead to the Ice Cave
							Pit Room with an unimportant treasure at the end, for example. With floor shuffle almost
							anything is possible!
						</p>
						<p>
							Regardless of how all of the fiends and Temple of Fiends are accessed, the entire game will
							always be made available. In other words: all of the floors, treaures, bosses, and items
							will be available somewhere. You may not need the CUBE to beat the game, but it nevertheless
							gets placed in a chest or NPC, depending on your flags, waiting to be found.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Allow Deep ToFR</b> is asking for trouble. This option causes ToFR, in its entirety, to
						be placed at the bottom of any dungeon. Normally it will always be placed at ground level,
						but enabling this option can create an absolutely punishing final challenge. This is not
						for the faint of heart!
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Encounter Rate</h3>
				Two sliders are available to independently scale the encounter rates of the overworld and in dungeons.
				The rates can be scaled from 0, meaning no random encounters whatsoever, to 150% of normal. Even without
				random encounters all the forced encounter tiles and boss fights will occur as normal.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="EnemyTrapTiles">Trap Tile Shuffle</h3>
				<b>Enemy Forced Encounter Tiles</b> are now shuffled. In this mode all of the standard trap formations are preserved
				and shuffled amongst the trap tiles. For example, the Wizard trap tile in Marsh could now be the Eye trap tile
				from the Ice Cave, and so on. If <b>Use Random Formations</b> is also checked, trap tiles will now be any random
				Formation 2 encounter from the standard encounter table. Formation 2 encounters are a lot less common in the
				standard FF1 game, and this option creates a lot of variety and potential grinding locations with rarer enemy groups.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="MapOpenProgressionExtended">Extended Open Progression</h3>
				An extension to Open Progression that now also removes a length of river so you can walk all the way from Coneria
				to Elfland without the aid of a canoe and addtionally provides a dock near the airship desert. The result of this
				is a decreased importance to early game canoe, and the possibility of going directly from Ship to Airship and finding
				the canoe much later on in the seed.
				<div>
					<img src="images/OpenProgressionRiver.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px; max-width:80%;" />
					<img src="images/OpenProgressionAirship.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 512px; max-width:80%;" />
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="anchor" id="ShortToFR">Shortened Temple of Fiends Revisited</h3>
				By popular demand, Shorten ToFR has been extracted from the Treasure Hunt mode. Treasure Hunt no longer
				defaults to	the short jump to the Chaos final floor. However, by enabling it, both Treasure Hunt mode and the
				normal game mode can be accelerated with the quick jump to Chaos.  As shown in the image on the left, the
				traditional Black Orb teleport will now bring you to a new room shown in the center. This room
				contains the seven chests of the Temple of Fiends Revisited for easy access, before the final challenge.
				Since the LUTE is no longer useful in this mode it is given to the party for free at the outset to play
				beautiful music at thier whim.
				<div>
					<img src="images/ToFRBlackOrb.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 336px; max-width:80%;" />
					<img src="images/ToFRShort.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 336px; max-width:80%;" />
					<img src="images/ToFRTraps.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: 336px; max-width:80%;" />
				</div>
				If you enable Short ToFR, you can also <b>Preserve Fiend Refights</b> to include two trap tiles in each
				direction around the final floor, as shown in the below image to the right. This will allow you to engage
				the fiends you would have otherwise skipped with the short ToFR. Each of these tiles will be a trap tile
				against one of the fight refights.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Minor Features &amp; Other Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Confused Old Men</b> gets the sages in Crescent Lake up and moving to waste just a little of your time.</li>
			<li>The venerable <b>Enable Buy 10</b> Convenience now includes the Caravan!</li>
			<li><b>Speed Hacks</b> now accelerates the lineup screen when shuffling party members.</li>
			<li>
				<b>Scale Boss Stats</b> now operates independently of the rest of the monsters. The Bosses in question
				comprise Garland, Astos, WarMECH, Lich, Lich2, Kary, Kary2, Kraken, Kraken2, Tiamat, Tiamat2, and CHAOS. All
				the other enemies are scaled according to the original Enemy Stats slider.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Critical Hit Count</b> lets you see how many times you critically hit, rather than just showing
				"Critical hit!!" regardless of how many attacks you performed. It's a minor UI change that improves the
				amount of information you have available.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Include Morale</b> is now explicit for enemy stat scaling. Uncheck this to force vanilla morale.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Zozo Melmond</b> creates some pretty bad parts of town. Watch out for those desert tiles.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Static EXP Distribution</b>, also known as <b>No Dan Mode</b>, gives a static amount of EXP per
				party member. Dead party member EXP doesn't go to the survivors - it just disappears. For those of
				you who think having party members be dead should be *bad*!
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Version 2.3.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>WarMECH Mode</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Vanilla. The classic 7th encounter on the Bridge of Destiny we all know and love.</li>
					<li>
						Patrolling. WarMECH is now an NPC roaming the Sky Palace 4th floor maze. Talk to him to engage! In
						this mode WarMECH is removed from the encounter table and cannot be fought on the Bridge of Destiny.
					</li>
					<li>
						Required. WarMECH is now an NPC waiting for you in front of Tiamat. WarMECH cannot be randomly encountered
						in this mode either, but will always be fought at the end of the hall.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>EXP/Gold Progressive Scaling</h3>
				Another Exp and Gold scaling mechanism has been added. Rather than a flat bonus, this option provides one
				that will grow over time as key items are found. These are the key items: <br />
<pre style="display: inline-block;">
LUTE        CROWN       CRYSTAL
HERB        KEY         TNT
ADAMANT     SLAB        RUBY
ROD         FLOATER     CHIME
TAIL        CUBE        BOTTLE
OXYALE      SHIP        CANOE
AIRSHIP     BRIDGE      CANAL
</pre>
				<p>
					It is important to note that this scaling is applied at the end of each battle and is recalculated
					each time, thus applying its bonus appropriate as it changes. It stacks with the standard EXP / Gold bonus.
				</p>
				These are the modes:
				<ul>
					<li>Disabled</li>
					<li>Increased to 150% at 12 Key Items</li>
					<li>Increased to 150% at 15 Key Items</li>
					<li>Increased to 200% at 12 Key Items</li>
					<li>Increased to 200% at 15 Key Items</li>
					<li>Increased by 5% per Key Item</li>
					<li>Increased by 10% per Key Item</li>
					<li>Increased by 20% per Key Item</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Version 2.2.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Treasure Hunt:</b> This new game mode replaces the original goal of beating Chaos
				with something else entirely. The four orbs are gone; replaced by dozens of smaller
				pieces. Collect enough of these randomized items to activate the BLACK ORB and reach the final battle.
				<br />&nbsp;
				<div>
					<img src="images/TreasureCount.png" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" />
					<img src="images/TreasureHunt.png" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" />
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Current count is graphical display that replaces original ORB display in main menu.</li>
					<li>32 random chests containing HEALs, PUREs, and other trash items are replaced by these items.</li>
					<li>Defeating LICH or KARY to activate the original EARTH and FIRE orbs will earn you 2 each.</li>
					<li>Defeating KRAKEN or TIAMAT to activate the original WATER and AIR orbs will earn you 4 each.</li>
					<li>Approach the BLACK ORB when you have collected to teleport to the final floor of the Temple of Fiends Revisited to face your final challenge.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Surprise Final Boss:</b> Replace Chaos with one of four new final challenges composed of new formations of familiar enemies.
				This option pairs well with Shard Hunt but can be used in a standard race as well. Be warned though - these new formations can be pretty unforgiving.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Item Magic:</b> Items casting spells, such as the White Shirt and the Defense have their
				spell shuffled among all possible spells except for spells only usable out of battle.
				In order to make it clear what each item casts, the item's name has been replaced with the
				spell name while keeping the gear icon at the end that was originally there.
				For example, you can get super lucky and have a NUKE Helm or you could be unlucky and only
				find items such as a LOCK Staff or DARK Sword.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Minor Features &amp; Other Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Improved Turn Order Randomization shuffles the initial turn order bias so that the enemies and
				allies are initially mixed together. Then each turn the number of random swaps is increased
				from 16 to 64, thus increasing the entropy that determines each turn's order in battle. The
				end result is that the party is more likely to strike sooner each turn and that on average
				the enemies will act later than they would without this enabled, making the game somewhat easier.
			</li>
			<li>
				Enable Dash is now reversed. Running is the default speed now; holding B will slow to half pace.
				This is now possible on foot and in the canoe, as well as on board the ship and airship.
			</li>
			<li>
				Change Unrunnable RUN -> WAIT now defaults to <b>enabled.</b> However it has been changed
				so that <i>it can be disabled even when Unrunnable Formations are shuffled!</i>
				This harrowing mode does in fact mean there will no way to know if an encounter is unrunnable
				or if your luck is simply bad. Feel free to disable it in combination with Unrunnable Shuffle
				if you wish to know the stress of never being sure if you can possibly run away.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<h1>Version 2.1.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Unrunnable Formations Shuffle:</b> The non-boss formations that are unrunnable can now be
				shuffled. The IronGOL and WzSahag/R.Sahag fights share their formations with bosses
				and will remain unrunnable. The IMPs around Coneria are kept out of shuffle as
				well to avoid a super early game unrunnable and impossible IMP situation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Change Unrunnable RUN -> WAIT:</b> complements the above by replacing the RUN
				command with WAIT when the battle is unrunnable. It is automatically enabled when
				Unrunnable Formations Shuffle is on, but it can also be turned on to learn the
				standard unrunnable formations for a beginner. <b>
					Updated in 2.2 so that it
					can now be disabled even with Unrunnable Shuffle!
				</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Surprise Bonus Shuffle:</b>The bonus that some enemy formations like Phantoms and
				WarMECH have to their surprise chance can be shuffled to other enemy formations.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Enemy Formation Frequency Shuffle:</b> The frequency of encounter groups
				can now be shuffled. First for each table the enemies in slots 1-4 are shuffled; then
				the resulting 3-8 slots are shuffled. The end result is that his means former slot 7 and
				8 encounters now all have a one in three chance of becoming one of the common groups.
				WarMECH is excluded from this and remains locked to slot 7.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Random Weapon and Armor:</b> When shuffling weapons and armor shops,
				there is now an option to randomize those items instead of shuffle the existing
				vanilla pool of shop items. This wacky setting enables the possibility of Masmunes or
				Ribbons for sale. Each Weapon or Armor will appear in no more than one location, so
				remember where the good stuff is if you have to come back!
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Allow Unsafe Pirates:</b> When shuffling enemy scripts this is now distinct
				and when not enabled will force the Pirates to their default Attack only script.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Force Default Starting GP:</b> Start the game with 400 GP regardless of scaling.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Minor Features &amp; Other Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Speed Hacks are now even faster than before in battles.	Respond Rate has been adapted so numbers less than
				8 can be used to help learn the game without being painfully slow. 8 remains the default and fastest setting.
			</li>
			<li>
				The SHIP will now appear in the nearest <b>Inner Sea</b> dock (but never a river) to where it is found:
				<ul>
					<li>Northwest Castle, Marsh Cave, Elfland, Crescent Lake, and Volcano all spawn the SHIP north of Elfland.</li>
					<li>Ice Cave and Pravoka SHIPs spawn near Pravoka.</li>
					<li>Matoya's Cave spawns nearby.</li>
					<li>Dwarf Cave spawns nearby.</li>
					<li>Coneria, Temple of Fiends, and all locations outside of the inner sea (which would have required the airship to retrieve) will spawn the SHIP in Coneria.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Chaos Rush now unlocks all doors in ToFR and provides the LUTE immediately as well.</li>
			<li>Black Belt Absorb Bug Fixed. Black Belt and Master absorb will now always be equal to level if no armor is equipped.</li>
			<li>Enemy AoE Spells on all enemies now also hit the caster.</li>
			<li>Enemy Elemental Resistences Bug Fixed. XFER will now work, and AFIR when cast by enemies will work.</li>
			<li>Ribbon Text Fixed to play nicely with modders editing the ribbon text. Though it may seem strange, ensure when modding the ribbon text to keep its length to 8 characters.</li>
			<li>Start screen displays full flags and seed info (was briefly broken by 2.0 changes to flags)</li>
			<li>Credits Updates</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<h1>Version 2.0.0</h1>
		<h2>Major Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>NPC Shuffle!</h3>
				There is a new tab 'Treasures' available with the option to shuffle Treasures and
				NPCs. Any NPC that gives an item in the vanilla game can now be shuffled in with the
				treasure shuffle. There are 2 main options, each with additional related options
				the 'Treasures' tab:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Main NPC Items:</b> This adds Bridge, Lute, Ship, Rod, Canoe, Cube, Bottle
						to the pool of items to be shuffled. The NPCs giving those items could have any
						other shuffled treasure instead. (Excluding Caravan which is limited to items that
						show up on the Inventory screen)
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Fetch Quest Rewards:</b> This adds Crystal, Herb, Key, Canal, Xcalber, Oxyale,
						and Chime to the pool of items to be shuffled. The NPCs giving those items could have
						any other shuffled treasure instead.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Incentives</h3>
				Of the many new incentives options on the 'Treasures' tab, the 3 most important
				ones are related to NPCs and quest items.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Incentivized Locations:</b> These options incentivize locations in the game
						or groups of NPCs.
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Main NPCs:</b>
								This incentivizes King, Princess, Bikke, Sarda, Sage, Robot, and Carvan Item Shop Slot.
								Those NPCs will be treated the same as incentivized teasure chests and will prefer
								to draw an item from the incentivized item pool if possible. Note that the Caravan
								item will still be shuffled by the Shop shuffle too.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Fetch Quest NPCs:</b>
								This incentivizes Astos, Matoya, Prince, Nerrick, Smith, Fairy, and Lefein. Those
								NPCs will be treated the same as incentivized teasure chests and will prefer
								to draw an item from the incentivized item pool if possible. If you have both this
								and the 'Other Quest Items' incentivized (see below) it tends to result in a long
								fetch quest kind of like the Crown -> Canal chain in the vanilla early game --
								except it's random and can be late in the game -- so it's a lot of back and forth
								to get just 1 item in the end.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Incentivized Items:</b> In earlier randomizer versions the incentive item
						pool included all required items (Crown, TNT, Slab and sometimes Ruby), Adamant,
						Tail, Masamune, and Ribbon. However, most of the actual required items could not
						be shuffled. With NPC shuffle, any shuffled item that is required will continue to
						be included in the incentive pool by default. This can include Bridge, Lute, Ship,
						Key, Canal, Rod, Canoe, Floater, Cube, Oxyale, Chime but may also include any item
						leading to those items when a partial NPC shuffle is done.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Other Quest Items:</b>
						This includes any other quest item even if they are not required. These are sometimes
						referred to as 'Fetch Quest Items' and would include Crown, Crystal, Herb, TNT,
						Ruby, Bottle, Slab, Adamant when all NPC items are shuffled.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep in mind that each incentive option with a group of items or locations
						will only be able to incentivize those items or locations if they are
						<i>shuffled</i>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Map Edits</h3>
				There is a new tab 'Maps' with 2 new options, plus the Ordeals Pillars shuffle
				relocated from the Shuffle tab:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Keyless ToFR:</b>
						Updated in 2.1.0 so all Mystic KEY locked doors in Temple of Fiends Revisted have been unlocked.
						You will begin the game with the LUTE ready to challenge Chaos as soon as you like.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Titans Trove:</b>
						The Titan moved a few squares to the West and now blocks access to the
						4 treasure chests in this cave even if you come from the backside via the Airship.
						This more than triples the chance that RUBY is required (but it's still pretty rare).
						<br /><img src="images/TitansTrove.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br />
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Open Progression:</b>
						This is a collection of small map tweaks that open up the possibilities for item
						placement and progression through the game. A total of about 30 map tiles are edited.
						In order:
						<ul>
							<li>
								A land path from the starting area to Dwarf Cave. If you get an early CANOE
								you can also walk south across the Canal Bridge to Elfland, Marsh, Cresent Lake,
								and Volcano.
								<br /><img src="images/WalkToDwarfCave.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br />
							</li>
							<li>
								A small river extension to join the Volcano and Ice Cave river systems near
								the tiny forest in the middle. If you get an early CANOE you can travel from
								Pravoka to Volcano, etc.
								<br /><img src="images/IceVolcanoRiver.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br />
							</li>
							<li>
								A dock near Onrac and a dock near Mirage Tower. This increases the value of
								the Canal which would otherwise be very unlikely to be required with NPC shuffle.
								With both Main NPC Items and Fetch Quest Rewards shuffle options turned on, this
								means FLOATER is not 100% required to kill Chaos (but you should still always be
								able to find it).
								<br /><img src="images/OnracDock.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br />
								<br /><img src="images/MirageDock.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br />
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Minor Features &amp; Other Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Free Airship:</b>
				The Airship spawns on the starting tile of the game. FLOATER is replaced with a
				cozy CABIN.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Free Orbs:</b>
				Begin the game with all four orbs lit. That was easy!
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Easy Mode:</b>
				Chance of random encounters are heavily reduced and all enemys have 10% of their
				HP after the random scaling has been applied. Effectively this turns a 20-500%
				slider into 2-50%, but for HP only.
			</li>
			<li>'Castle Ordeals' has moved to the Maps tab and renamed to Castle Ordeals Pillars</li>
			<li>
				Early Bridge was renamed Free Bridge. The Bridge item is also replaced with a CABIN
				if NPC shuffle is turned on.
			</li>
			<li>Early Rod and Early Canoe have been renamed to Early Sarda Item and Early Sage Item</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>A0 HEALs??:</b>
				This can happen with any consumable item but most commonly comes up with HEAL. If
				you have 99 HEALs from shopping and you open a chest with one inside it will
				increment it to 100 but the inventory can't display it so it shows A0, A1, A2, etc.
				This generally doesn't hurt anything and the HEAL works as expected. In the original
				game this was also bugged but instead of giving you A0 items it just threw the item
				away.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Astos text is strange:</b>
				Overall the NPC item text is less than ideal. It was a quick generic text that
				could be used everywhere and we expect to improve upon it in later versions. Astos
				is commonly mentioned as the most strange, and it's worth remembering that in the
				vanilla game he also tells you what your reward is for turning in the CROWN before
				he attacks you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Free Item From the King:</b>
				The King is far more trusting of random adventurers in NPC shuffle and he will
				give you the reward item *before* you rescue the Princess. This might be fixed
				later on, but usually doesn't make much difference.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bridge Scene on the Canal:</b>
				This is not an error in the randomizer but actually the original game behavior if
				you walk over the Canal before walking over the Bridge. That just wasn't possible
				without the map tweaks and you had no reason to try it unless you had the Canoe.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Duplicate Item in Shop:</b>
				In some flagsets the Caravan Item Slot isn't incentivized or the randomizer runs
				out of incentive items to put there and it picks a random HEAL or HOUSE instead.
				Since the Shop shuffle also mixes things up before the item placement, a duplicate
				item can remain after everything is placed.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Flag String is no longer shown on the main menu:</b>
				Sadly all the new flags couldn't fit in the default text space on the start screen.
				The developers have a fix in progress that should be ready for 2.1 or sooner.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>
					I think I'm softlocked in the early game. I can't find either the BRIDGE or
					the SHIP, help!
				</b>
				<br />Try walking from the starting area to the Dwarf Cave. This usually happens
				the first time players try the 'Open Progression' map tweaks with Main NPC Items
				Shuffle on.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>Why isn't Dr. Unne shuffled?</b>
				<br />In short, it's because he doesn't actually give you an <i>item</i>. He's a
				lot closer to the Elf Doctor that wakes up the Prince. By having an item he sets
				an internal flag for the game to let the other NPC give you something. That being
				said, keep an eye on future versions and maybe Dr. Unne or even the Dragon's Class
				Change events will get shuffled someday too!
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>A second Bridge over the Canal?!?</b>
				<br />If NPC Shuffle options are turned on, a Bridge will be left behind after the
				Canal is blown up. This is done to prevent soft locks when you get a very early
				Canoe and could potentially end up stranded on the wrong side of the Canal and unable
				to get back to your Ship.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>
					I've played a few NPC shuffle seeds and it feels like I have to check every
					treasure chest in the game. Is my luck terrible?
				</b>
				<br />Make sure that you don't have a lot more Items incentivized than there are
				Item Locations to put them. Any incentivized item that doens't make it into an
				incentivized location ends up in a random chest somewhere. If 4 or more required
				items are in random chests you're going to need to check a lot of chests!
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>How many items do I have incentivized?</b>
				<br />It will depend on the flagsets, but in general here are the approximate counts:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you shuffled Treasures only (not shuffle Main NPC Items or Fetch Quest Rewards):
						You have 4 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you shuffled Treasures and Main NPC Items but not Fetch Quest Rewards:
						You have 10 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column,
						plus 2 additional if you have 'Other Quest Items' checked.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you shuffled Treasures and Main NPC Items and Fetch Quest Rewards:
						You have 10 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column,
						plus 8 additional if you have 'Other Quest Items' checked.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you shuffled Treasures and Fetch Quest Rewards but not Main NPC Items:
						You have 4 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column,
						plus 2 additional if you have 'Other Quest Items' checked.
					</li>
					<li>
						Other flags may alter this slightly, including the Early Sage convenience flag
						or Open Progression map flag.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>
				<b>
					I played the beta version and really liked having *all* of the incentive options.
					Where'd they go?
				</b>
				<br />Awesome, we love beta testers! A lot of options tested in the beta didn't
				all make the cut for 2.0.0, sorry if your favorite flagset is gone. There's still a
				ton of new options and we can always expand to add those options later on. Stop by
				the discord and let us know what you'd like to see in upcoming versions.
